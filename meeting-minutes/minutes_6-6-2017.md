# Boro Web Dev
## Meeting minutes: June 6, 2017

Hey everyone, Thanks for coming out last night! We had a small, but great meetup at Panera.

I think we are going to move to a new location for our next coding meetup. June 22, Thursday is the date and more details to come soon. We decided to set the format up to be a bit of socializing and then coding for the remainder of the time.

Some of the resources we discussed were:
1. Bootcamps: 
    * Nashville Software School
    * Lamda School Bootcamp
    * The Iron Yard

2. Training Resources: 
    * Watchandcode.com (Practical Javascript)
    * Wes Bos's 'What the Flexbox'
    * Udemy, Coursera, FreeCodeCamp, Code Academy, Khan Academy

Since there is always discussion about preferred code editors, Sublime Text, Brackets and Atom were all mentioned.

To stay in touch, be sure to checkout Slack:

There is a #nashville #murfreesboro #freecodecamp channel and others to check out.

Thanks all for coming out, I hope to see everyone (and more!) again.
