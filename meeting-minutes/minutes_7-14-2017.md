# Boro Web Dev
## Meeting minutes: July 13, 2017
Good little turnout, Michelle, Matt, Bethany, and Andy were present.

The focus of today's meeting was to find a project for the group to tackle. We have many ideas, but decided to keep it a little more simple. Matt proposed an idea of identifying a simple website and everybody would try to recreate the main page on their own. We decided on recreating 'High Country Adventures', a rafting company's website:

http://www.hcrivers.com/

During the website recreation process, we will be each taking notes of what was easy, what stumped us, and any other thoughts that come up during the process.

Matt also brought our attention to a live coding session that occurs every Sunday night on Twitch.tv by Suz Hinton. That sounds like a neat and interesting resource we should all check out!

We each began working on recreating the High Country Adventures website and chatted a bit.

At the very end, there was some discussion of coding bootcamps. Michelle brought up Lamda Schools (mentioned previously), which has a very interesting payment plan. In some cases, you pay $0 to take the course (or a reduced rate). Upon getting your first developer job, you owe the school the tuition, or they take a % of your new position. Interesting concept for sure!

The next meeting is at Starbucks on August 3, 2017.
