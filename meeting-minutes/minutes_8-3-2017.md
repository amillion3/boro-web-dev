# Boro Web Dev
## Meeting minutes: August 3, 2017
A small, but great meetup tonight. Thanks to Michelle and Richard for coming out tonight!

Today's meeting was pretty informal, with most time being dedicated to coding. Everyone was working on the HCA recreation page and making good progress.

We discussed a few things, from music preferences to the closing of the Iron Yard to Udemy and the Web Development course by Colt Steele.

A couple resources discussed:

Keep working on your HCA pages and post them up on Twist for feedback or assistance! Hopefully, we can tackle the Rolodex project next. That will be a bigger undertaking, but a good challenge!

Andy will be busy with NSS's Jumpstart program (a 3-week, mini bootcamp) followed by an extended family vacation. Hopefully someone else will setup a meetup while he is busy!
