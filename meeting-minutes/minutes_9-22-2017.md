# Boro Web Dev
## Meeting minutes: September 22, 2017

Great turnout today! Andy, Jason, Michelle, Richard, Shaun, and Valerie were all present.

We discussed Nashville Software School (NSS) for a short while. Jason relayed his experience at NSS and Andy also provided some feedback on the NSS Jumpstart program. Shaun talked a bit about his job search efforts and time at the Iron Yard, he wouldn't trade it for anything!

After this, we all jumped into some coding and tried to help each other out.

Michelle mentioned the following resources: Coursera, EdX, freeCodeCamp, and the Colt Steele course in Udemy. WatchAndCode.com was also brought up as a good way to focus on learning JavaScript.

The Rocketbook notebook was brought up and seems quite interesting. A reusable notebook that will sync with Google Drive, Evernote and more resources. After you have filled the notebook, you throw it in the microwave (yes, the microwave) to erase all the pages. Neat!

Matt is moving away to Charlotte, NC to pursue an exciting opporutnity there. Bye Matt!
